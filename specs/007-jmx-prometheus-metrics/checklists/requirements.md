# Specification Quality Checklist: Prometheus JMX Metrics Export

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: January 18, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification:
- Clearly defines three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) that are independently testable
- Provides 13 functional requirements and 7 security/portability requirements
- Includes concrete edge cases with expected behaviors
- Defines 7 measurable success criteria focused on user outcomes
- Maintains technology-agnostic language while being specific about requirements
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are unambiguous and testable
